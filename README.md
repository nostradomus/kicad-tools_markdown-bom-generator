## What

This repository contains python code to generate a `markdown` formatted file which will contain the bill-of-materials for a [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org) project. The table inside this `markdown` document sources its content from the [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org) `.csv` export.

This generator has been developed, based on [KiCad version 5.1.2](http://kicad-pcb.org/blog/2019/04/KiCad-5.1.2-Release/).
